# Hardware and connection
In order this to work you need additional hardware: inverter and bluetooth module (HC-05 or HC-06 or something else, also you don't need module and inverter if your transmitter has internal one)
One important thing: Module should be configured to work on 57600 baud rate, otherwise it won't work. 
Connect inverter to your Smart Port and then connect bluetooth module to the inverter. You now can connect your phone to your bluetooth module and view data

## Tested modules

Currently we support classic BL,BLE and integrated bluetooth modules into your transmitter. We currently tested them on the HC-05, HC-06, HC-09, HM-10. Make sure that when using BLE module you should disable PIN code (if possible). For classic BL module to appear in the list, you should pair it to your Android device first.

## HC-06 Configuration

By default, HC-06 is configured for 9600bps. To configure, use any USB-to-serial converter and serial client. Mac and Linux can use Terminal `screen` command. Windows users can use [Putty](http://www.putty.org/)

HC-06 module will expect that each command will be entered very fast (AFAIR max 1s between letters). So the best option here is to open text editor, type commands there and then copy them one by one into serial software.

1. `AT+NAMEyournamehere` - no spaces!
1. `AT+PIN1234` - PIN, no spaces again
1. `AT+ENABLEIND0` (you can ommit this command if your module does not support it)
1. `AT+BAUD7` - set port speed to 57600
