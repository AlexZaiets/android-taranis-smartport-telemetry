# Hardware and connection

In order this to work you need additional hardware: inverter and bluetooth module (HC-05 or HC-06 or something else)
One important thing: Module should be configured to work on 57600 baud rate, otherwise it won't work. 
Connect inverter to your Smart Port and then connect bluetooth module to the inverter. You now can connect your phone to your bluetooth module and view data
